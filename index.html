          <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Our educational excursion commenced with an exploration of Cebu City's renowned attractions. We initiated our journey at SM Seaside Cebu, one of the country's expansive malls, providing us an opportunity to unwind and navigate through its contemporary amenities.



            Subsequently, we ventured to Fort San Pedro, the oldest triangular bastion fort in the Philippines, gaining insights into its Spanish colonial past. Our visit then continued to the Minor Basilica of the Holy Child of Cebu (Basilica Minore del Santo Niño), a pivotal church steeped in profound religious and cultural importance. We concluded our day at the National Museum in Cebu, where we admired a diverse collection of artifacts, artworks, and historic exhibits that eloquently narrated Cebu’s rich cultural legacy.
